# Loan Default Prediction Competition

## Overview

In this competition, we are tasked with predicting which clients are more likely to default on their loans. The challenge emphasizes the need for solutions that remain stable over time, as traditional data on credit history is often unavailable. Many potential borrowers, such as young individuals or those who prefer using cash, lack substantial credit history, making it difficult for consumer finance providers to accurately assess loan repayment capabilities. 

By leveraging data science, we aim to enhance prediction models for repayment abilities, making loans more accessible to those who need them most. This competition is hosted by Home Credit, a global consumer finance provider founded in 1997, committed to responsible lending particularly for people with little or no credit history.

## Problem Statement

Consumer finance providers currently employ various statistical and machine learning methods, known as scorecards, to predict loan risk. These models must be updated regularly to adapt to the ever-changing behaviors of clients. The stability of these scorecards over time is crucial to ensure consistent performance and avoid issuing loans to clients less likely to repay.

## Evaluation Criteria

Submissions will be evaluated based on the stability of their predictions over time using a gini stability metric. The evaluation involves several steps:

1. **Gini Calculation**: For each week's predictions, a Gini score is calculated as follows:
   
   \[ \text{gini} = 2 \times \text{AUC} - 1 \]

2. **Trend Analysis**: A linear regression \(a \cdot x + b\) is fitted through the weekly Gini scores, and a falling rate is determined as \( \text{min}(0, a) \).

3. **Variability Penalty**: The standard deviation of the residuals from the linear regression is calculated and used to apply a penalty for model variability.

4. **Final Metric**: The final stability metric is computed as:

   \[ \text{stability metric} = \text{mean(gini)} + 88.0 \cdot \text{min}(0, a) - 0.5 \cdot \text{std(residuals)} \]

## Submission Guidelines

Please follow the specific format and file types outlined in the competition rules. Ensure your submission is evaluated correctly by adhering to the required structure for prediction outputs.
